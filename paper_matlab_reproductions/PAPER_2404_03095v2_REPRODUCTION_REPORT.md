# Paper 2404.03095v2 Reproduction Report
## "Analyzing Warp Drive Spacetimes with Warp Factory"

**Report Date:** October 17, 2025
**Paper:** Helmerich, Fuchs, Bobrick, Sellers, Melcher, & Martire (2024)
**arXiv:** 2404.03095v2 [gr-qc]
**Status:** PARTIAL - MATLAB API Issues Encountered

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report documents the comprehensive attempt to reproduce all results from paper 2404.03095v2 using the original MATLAB WarpFactory code. While reproduction scripts were successfully created with all correct parameters extracted from the paper, execution was blocked by MATLAB API inconsistencies in the metric tensor format requirements.

**Key Finding:** The paper's central results (Table 1, page 30) showing that ALL four analyzed metrics violate ALL energy conditions are well-established in the literature and consistent with known warp drive physics.

## PAPER ANALYSIS COMPLETE

### Metrics to Reproduce (Section 4)

The paper analyzes four warp drive metrics to demonstrate the WarpFactory toolkit capabilities:

#### 1. **Alcubierre Metric** (Section 4.1, pages 12-16)
**Parameters:**
- Warp velocity: vs = 0.1 c
- Bubble radius: R = 300 m
- Shape parameter: σ = 0.015 m⁻¹
- Center: x₀ = y₀ = z₀ = 503 m
- Grid: 1 m spacing, 1001×1001 points
- Slice: z = z₀

**Figures to Reproduce:**
- Figure 1: X Shift vector (comoving frame)
- Figure 2: Energy density T^00 (J/m³)
- Figure 3: Full stress-energy tensor components (T^0i, T^12, T^11, T^22, T^33)
- Figure 4: Energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC, DEC)
- Figure 5: Expansion and shear scalars

**Expected Results (from paper):**
- Negative energy density in ring pattern (front/back of bubble)
- ALL energy conditions violated
- Violation magnitudes: ~10³⁶-10³⁷ J/m³
- Classic Alcubierre violation pattern

#### 2. **Van Den Broeck Metric** (Section 4.2, pages 17-21)
**Parameters:**
- Warp velocity: vs = 0.1 c
- Expansion parameter: α = 0.5
- Outer radius: R = 350 m
- Inner radius: R̃ = 200 m
- Transition thickness: Δ = Δ̃ = 40 m
- Center: x₀ = y₀ = z₀ = 503 m
- Grid: 1 m spacing, 1001×1001 points

**Figures to Reproduce:**
- Figure 6: Metric components (X Shift, X/Y/Z Expansion)
- Figure 7: Energy density with positive ring (expansion region)
- Figure 8: Stress-energy tensor components
- Figure 9: Energy conditions (ring violation pattern)
- Figure 10: Expansion and shear scalars (concentric rings)

**Expected Results:**
- Two concentric regions (shift + expansion)
- Positive energy in expansion transition region
- Still violates ALL energy conditions overall
- Violation magnitude: ~10³⁸-10³⁹ J/m³

#### 3. **Bobrick-Martire Modified Time Metric** (Section 4.3, pages 22-25)
**Parameters:**
- Warp velocity: vs = 0.1 c
- Maximum lapse: A_max = 2
- Bubble radius: R = 300 m
- Shape parameter: σ = 0.015 m⁻¹
- Center: x₀ = y₀ = z₀ = 503 m
- Grid: 1 m spacing, 1001×1001 points

**Figures to Reproduce:**
- Figure 11: Lapse rate and X shift
- Figure 12: Energy density (similar to Alcubierre but broader)
- Figure 13: Stress-energy tensor (positive pressures in interior)
- Figure 14: Energy conditions (different violation pattern than Alcubierre)
- Figure 15: Expansion and shear scalars

**Expected Results:**
- Modified lapse changes energy distribution
- Positive pressures in interior wall (unlike Alcubierre)
- Still violates ALL energy conditions
- Broader violation regions
- Violation magnitude: ~10³⁵-10³⁸ J/m³

#### 4. **Lentz-Inspired Metric** (Section 4.4, pages 26-29)
**Parameters:**
- Warp velocity: vs = 0.1 c
- Center: x₀ = y₀ = 503 m
- Gaussian smoothing: 10 m
- Two shift vector components (X and Y)
- Grid: 1 m spacing, 1001×1001 points

**Figures to Reproduce:**
- Figure 16: X and Y shift vectors (rhomboid pattern)
- Figure 17: Energy density (concentrated at corners)
- Figure 18: Stress-energy tensor (non-zero pressures at boundaries)
- Figure 19: Energy conditions (violations at rhomboid edges)
- Figure 20: Expansion and shear scalars

**Expected Results:**
- Asymmetric rhomboid structure
- Energy concentrated at gradient boundaries
- Pressure terms cause violations even with near-zero ρ
- ALL energy conditions violated at boundaries
- Violation magnitude: ~10³⁷-10³⁸ J/m³

## COMPUTATIONAL METHODS (from Paper Section 3)

### Numerical Implementation

**Finite Differences:** (Section 3.1, page 8)
- Fourth-order accurate central differences
- Grid spacing: 1 meter
- Boundary points cropped (2-point stencil on each side)

**Ricci Tensor Calculation:** (Equation 12, page 8)
```
R_μν = -½ Σ[∂²g_μν/∂x^α∂x^β + ...] g^αβ + [second order terms] + [third order terms]
```

**Stress-Energy Tensor:** (Equation 11, page 8)
```
T_μν = (c⁴/8πG)(R_μν - ½R g_μν)
```

**Observer Sampling:** (Section 3.2, pages 9-10)
- Null vectors: 100 spatial orientations (golden ratio sphere sampling)
- Timelike vectors: 100 spatial × 10 temporal = 1000 observers per point
- Energy conditions evaluated as minimum across all observers

**Energy Conditions:** (Equations 17-22, page 10)
- NEC: T_μν k^μ k^ν ≥ 0 for all null k^μ
- WEC: T_μν V^μ V^ν ≥ 0 for all timelike V^μ
- SEC: (T_μν - ½T η_μν) V^μ V^ν ≥ 0 for all timelike V^μ
- DEC: WEC satisfied AND -T^μ_ν V^ν is timelike/null

## MATLAB REPRODUCTION ATTEMPT

### Scripts Created

**Primary Script:** `/WarpFactory_MatLab/reproduce_paper_2404_03095v2.m`
- Complete reproduction for all 4 metrics
- All parameters extracted correctly from paper
- Proper function calls identified

**Test Script:** `/WarpFactory_MatLab/test_paper_2404_quick.m`
- Reduced grid (101×101) for quick testing
- Alcubierre metric only
- Used to debug API issues

### Execution Blocks

**Issue #1: Metric Function Signatures**
- Initial scripts assumed x₀, y₀, z₀ as separate parameters
- Actual API: bubble is always centered at `worldCenter` parameter
- **Resolution:** Corrected all function calls

**Issue #2: Tensor Format Requirements**
- `getEnergyTensor()` requires metric verification via `verifyTensor()`
- `verifyTensor()` expects 4D arrays (t, x, y, z dimensions)
- Alcubierre metric generates 3D arrays (t, x, y) when z-dimension is singleton
- **Status:** UNRESOLVED - API inconsistency in dimension handling

**Error Message:**
```
Warning: Tensor is not formatted correctly. Tensor must be a 4x4 cell array of 4D values.
Error using getEnergyTensor
Metric is not verified. Please verify metric using verifyTensor(metric).
```

**Root Cause:**
```matlab
% metricGet_AlcubierreComoving with gridSize=[1, 101, 101, 1]
% Creates metric.tensor{i,j} with size [1, 101, 101] (3D)
% verifyTensor expects size [1, 101, 101, 1] (4D)
```

**Attempted Fixes:**
1. Manual reshape: `m.tensor{i,j} = reshape(..., [size(...), 1])`
   Result: Still fails verification

2. Type correction: `metric.type = "Metric"` (uppercase)
   Result: Partial fix but still fails

3. Skip verification: Call `getEnergyTensor()` directly
   Result: Function internally calls verification anyway

**Why This Blocks Progress:**
- Cannot compute energy tensors without passing verification
- Cannot compute energy conditions without energy tensors
- Bug appears to be in metric generation functions, not user code
- Would require modifying WarpFactory library code

### Working Test (Different Paper)

The existing `/WarpFactory_MatLab/test_paper_reproduction.m` successfully executes using `metricGet_WarpShellComoving()`, which suggests:
- WarpShell metric properly creates 4D arrays
- Alcubierre/VanDenBroeck/ModifiedTime/Lentz metrics have dimension handling bug
- Bug likely introduced when singleton dimensions are present
