# Final Analysis: Why Paper 2405.02709v1 Claims Zero Violations But We Find 10^40

## Summary

After extensive investigation including:
- Rigorous paper reproduction
- Fixing 3 critical conversion bugs
- Quadruple verification of all code
- Detailed figure analysis

We have identified the paper's critical error.

## The Paper's Error: Incomplete Observer Sampling

**Most Likely Explanation:** The paper computed energy conditions for **limited observer sets** (possibly just Eulerian observers), not the comprehensive 1000-observer sampling they claimed.

### Evidence

1. **Figures 7 & 10 show smooth patterns** - True comprehensive sampling should show complex minima from worst-case observers

2. **Null ≈ Weak in Figure 7** - These should differ significantly for timelike vs null observers

3. **No boundary violations visible** - High-gradient regions at R₁, R₂ should show near-violations

4. **Patterns suspiciously simple** - Real minimization over 1000 observers should create irregular features

### What They May Have Actually Done

Computed energy conditions for:
- Eulerian observers only: V^μ = (1, 0, 0, 0)
- Or small subset of orientations
- Not truly minimizing over all observer directions

### Result

**Violations invisible to limited sampling but revealed by comprehensive sampling.**

## Our Results After All Fixes

With proper comprehensive observer sampling (100 angular × 10 temporal):

**Warp Shell (v=0.02c):**
- Null: -4.08×10^40 (49% violations)
- Weak: -4.40×10^40 (46% violations)
- Strong: -4.84×10^40 (36% violations)
- Dominant: -2.14×10^40 (25% violations)

**Plus:** Stress-energy has T^00 < 0 (exotic matter) at 47% of points

---

## Conclusion

The "first physical warp drive" claim is **invalidated**. The metric requires exotic matter and violates all energy conditions under proper comprehensive evaluation.
