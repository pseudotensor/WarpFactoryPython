## The 10 Novel Approaches

### 1. Pulsed Acceleration (Category A) ⭐
**Status:** Implemented

**Idea:** Discrete velocity jumps instead of smooth transition

**Physics:**
- v(t) = Σ Δvᵢ × H(t - tᵢ) (Heaviside steps)
- Violations concentrated in brief pulses
- Constant-velocity between pulses (proven physical)

**Why It Might Work:**
- Integral of brief intense violation < prolonged mild violation?
- Most of timeline is violation-free
- Like impulsive orbital maneuvers

**Challenge:**
- Discontinuous metric derivatives
- Very large but brief ∂_t g

**Testable:** YES (with current WarpFactory)

---

### 2. Rotating Warp Bubble (Category A) ⭐
**Status:** Implemented

**Idea:** Use angular momentum and frame-dragging

**Physics:**
- Rotating mass → Lense-Thirring effect
- ω_drag = 2GJ/(c²r³)
- Asymmetric rotation → net thrust

**Why It Might Work:**
- Stationary in rotating frame (∂_t g = 0!)
- Frame-dragging is proven GR effect
- Like Kerr black hole propulsion

**Challenge:**
- Frame-dragging too weak (v ~ 10^-20 c)
- Rotation rates needed would destroy shell

**Testable:** Partially (need axisymmetric code)

---

### 3. Negative Mass Dipole (Category C) ⭐
**Status:** Implemented

**Idea:** Positive mass ahead, negative mass behind

**Physics:**
- Bondi runaway motion paradox
- Both masses accelerate same direction
- Static in accelerating frame!

**Why It Might Work:**
- Eliminates time-dependence entirely
- Constant acceleration from mass distribution
- Energy conserved (E_total = 0)

**Challenge:**
- Requires negative mass (highly exotic)
- Never observed in nature

**Testable:** YES (as Gedankenexperiment)

---

### 4. Casimir Cascade (Category B) ⭐
**Status:** Implemented

**Idea:** Nested Casimir cavities for quantum vacuum thrust

**Physics:**
- Casimir: ρ = -ℏc/(240π²d⁴) < 0
- Dynamical Casimir: Moving boundaries → photon emission
- Cascade amplification

**Why It Might Work:**
- Real quantum effect (experimentally verified 2011)
- Creates genuine negative energy
- QFT energy conditions ≠ classical

**Challenge:**
- Effect tiny (ρ ~ -10^9 vs need 10^40)
- Requires 10^27 amplification

**Testable:** Partially (as correction to classical)

---

### 5. Topological Transition (Category D)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Brief wormhole connection allows "discontinuous" velocity

**Physics:**
- Spacetime topology change
- Einstein-Rosen bridge formation/collapse
- Quantum tunneling analog for metric

**Why It Might Work:**
- Avoids smooth transition requirement
- Like quantum tunneling through barrier
- Topology change in quantum gravity

**Challenge:**
- Requires quantum gravity
- Topology change very exotic
- Unclear if compatible with GR

**Testable:** NO (beyond current physics)

---

### 6. Time-Reversal Symmetric (Category A)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Acceleration + deceleration together, use symmetry

**Physics:**
- T-symmetric process: accel from 0→v, then decel from v→0
- Violations might cancel due to CPT theorem
- Net result: displacement without net violation

**Why It Might Work:**
- CPT symmetry fundamental in physics
- Forward and backward might cancel
- Like particle-antiparticle annihilation

**Challenge:**
- Still need to accelerate initially
- Cancellation might not be complete
- Requires going backward too

**Testable:** YES (simulate both directions)

---

### 7. Electromagnetic Coupling (Category A)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Add strong electromagnetic fields to metric

**Physics:**
- Einstein-Maxwell equations
- EM stress-energy: T^EM_μν adds to gravitational
- Magnetic pressure could offset violations

**Why It Might Work:**
- EM can have exotic properties (negative pressure)
- Coupling might create cancellations
- Extra degrees of freedom for optimization

**Challenge:**
- Need enormous EM fields
- Coupling to charged particles
- Maxwell equations in curved spacetime

**Testable:** YES (requires EM solver addition)

---

### 8. Oscillating Shell (Category A)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Rapidly oscillating shell mass/radius

**Physics:**
- M(t) = M₀ + δM sin(ωt)
- High-frequency oscillation → time-averaged metric
- Averaging might reduce violations

**Why It Might Work:**
- Rapid oscillations average out
- Like RWA (rotating wave approximation) in QM
- Frequency can be tuned

**Challenge:**
- Physical mechanism for mass oscillation?
- Might just time-average the violations (no help)

**Testable:** YES (extend time-dependent framework)

---

### 9. Vacuum Engineering (Category B)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Modify local vacuum properties (c_eff, G_eff)

**Physics:**
- Metamaterials change ε, μ → c_eff
- Analogy: Spacetime as medium, engineering its properties
- Effective field theory approach

**Why It Might Work:**
- Metamaterials proven in EM
- Spacetime might have similar effective description
- Change rules instead of fighting them

**Challenge:**
- Unclear how to engineer spacetime properties
- Requires physics beyond standard GR
- Mechanism unknown

**Testable:** NO (need new physics theory)

---

### 10. Schwarzschild-Interior Shell (Category C)
**Status:** Conceptual

**Idea:** Use Schwarzschild interior solution (uniform density)

**Physics:**
- Interior of uniform sphere has different metric than shell
- Might have different time-derivative properties
- Could be more amenable to acceleration

**Why It Might Work:**
- Interior metric is smoother than shell
- Different lapse function structure
- Less concentrated stress-energy

**Challenge:**
- Uniform density still requires huge mass
- Interior might have different issues

**Testable:** YES (modify warp shell approach)
