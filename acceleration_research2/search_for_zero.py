Search for Zero Violation Acceleration

GOAL: Find ANY configuration that achieves ZERO energy condition violations
during acceleration, not just minimize them.

KEY INSIGHT from paper 2405.02709:
- Constant velocity: ∂_t g_μν = 0 → ZERO violations ✓
- Acceleration: ∂_t g_μν ≠ 0 → violations ✗

QUESTION: Can we make ∂_t g_μν → 0 even during acceleration?

APPROACHES TO ZERO:
1. Infinite time limit: dv/dt → 0 (infinitely slow acceleration)
2. Infinite shells: N → ∞ (continuous velocity field)
3. Quantum corrections: Add Casimir to cancel classical
4. Special symmetries: Find cancellation conditions
5. Modified physics: Beyond Einstein equations
