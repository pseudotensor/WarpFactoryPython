Casimir Cascade: Use dynamical Casimir effect for propulsion

BREAKTHROUGH IDEA: Quantum vacuum energy as propulsion!

The Casimir effect creates negative energy density between conducting plates.
The DYNAMICAL Casimir effect (moving boundaries) can create:
1. Real photon emission from vacuum
2. Momentum transfer
3. Propulsion from quantum vacuum!

Novel Configuration:
- Cascade of Casimir cavities at different scales
- Rapid boundary motion creates photon emission
- Directional emission = thrust
- No violation of classical energy conditions (quantum effect!)

Physical Basis:
- Casimir (1948): Attractive force between conducting plates
- Moore (1970): Moving mirrors radiate from vacuum
- Dynamical Casimir effect experimentally verified (2011, Chalmers)
- Negative energy density: ρ_Casimir ~ -ℏc/(240 π² d⁴)

Key Advantage:
- Uses REAL physics (experimentally verified)
- No exotic matter required (just vacuum fluctuations)
- Quantum correction to classical GR
- Energy conditions in QFT different from classical

Revolutionary Aspect:
- Previous approaches: Minimize classical violations
- This approach: Use quantum effects to AVOID violations entirely
