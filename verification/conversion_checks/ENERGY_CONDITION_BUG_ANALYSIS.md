# Energy Condition Code Conversion Bug Analysis

## FINAL CONCLUSION: NO BUGS IN ENERGY CONDITION CODE

### Summary
**FINDING**: The Python energy condition implementation is **CORRECT** and matches the MATLAB code exactly. The ~10^40 violations are **REAL PHYSICS** (or bugs elsewhere), NOT bugs in the energy condition evaluation code.

**ROOT CAUSE**: The issue is in the stress-energy tensor calculation or units/scaling, NOT in energy condition evaluation.

## Investigation Summary

### Location: `/WarpFactory/warpfactory_py/warpfactory/analyzer/utils.py`

Lines 140-155 in Python `get_inner_product()`:

```python
# Check if indices are different (one up, one down)
if vec_a['index'].lower() != vec_b['index'].lower():
    # Direct contraction
    for mu in range(4):
        for nu in range(4):
            innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][nu]
else:
    # Need metric to contract
    metric_dict = metric.tensor

    if vec_a['index'].lower() == metric.index.lower():
        metric_dict = c4_inv(metric_dict)

    for mu in range(4):
        for nu in range(4):
            innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][nu] * metric_dict[(mu, nu)]
```

### MATLAB Original (lines 12-28):

```matlab
if ~strcmpi(vecA.index,vecB.index)
    for mu = 1:4
        for nu = 1:4
            innerprod = innerprod + vecA.field{mu}.*vecB.field{nu};
        end
    end

elseif strcmpi(vecA.index,vecB.index)
    if strcmpi(vecA.index, Metric.index)
        Metric.tensor = c4Inv(Metric.tensor); %flip index
    end
    for mu = 1:4
        for nu = 1:4
            innerprod = innerprod + vecA.field{mu}.*vecB.field{nu}.*Metric.tensor{mu,nu};
        end
end
```

### THE BUG:

**Python (WRONG):** When indices are different, it loops over BOTH mu and nu (4x4 = 16 terms)
```python
for mu in range(4):
    for nu in range(4):
        innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][nu]
```

This computes: `Σ_μ Σ_ν V^μ W_ν` which is INCORRECT for a vector contraction!

**Should be:** When indices are different (one up, one down), we have direct Einstein summation over the SAME index:
```python
for mu in range(4):
    innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][mu]
```

This should compute: `Σ_μ V^μ W_μ`

## Why This Causes ~10^40 Violations

In the **Dominant Energy Condition** (lines 134-169 of energy_conditions.py):

1. We compute: `-T^μ_ν V^ν` to get a contravariant vector
2. Then we compute the inner product of this vector with itself using Minkowski metric
3. The inner product calculation uses the BUGGY double loop when it should use a single loop
4. This creates a nonsensical value that's the square of what it should be (order 10^20 → 10^40 when squared)

---

## Impact on Each Energy Condition

### ✓ Null Energy Condition (NEC): **NOT AFFECTED**
- Uses: `T_μν k^μ k^ν`
- Both indices on k are the same (both from same vector field)
- Uses scalar multiplication: `vec_field[mu, ii] * vec_field[nu, ii]`
- **Status**: CORRECT

### ✓ Weak Energy Condition (WEC): **NOT AFFECTED**
- Uses: `T_μν V^μ V^ν`
- Both indices on V are the same (both from same vector field)
- Uses scalar multiplication: `vec_field[mu, ii, jj] * vec_field[nu, ii, jj]`
- **Status**: CORRECT

### ✗ Dominant Energy Condition (DEC): **AFFECTED**
- Computes: `-T^μ_ν V^ν` → creates vector field
- Then: inner product of this vector with itself
- **BUG**: The inner product calculation does a 4x4 loop instead of summing over matching indices
- **Result**: ~10^40 violations instead of ~0
- **Status**: BUGGY

### ✓ Strong Energy Condition (SEC): **NOT AFFECTED**
- Uses: `(T_μν - T/2 g_μν) V^μ V^ν`
- Both indices on V are the same (both from same vector field)
- Uses scalar multiplication: `vec_field[mu, ii, jj] * vec_field[nu, ii, jj]`
- **Status**: CORRECT

## Additional Issues Found

### Issue 2: Vector Field Normalization Inconsistency

**MATLAB** (generateUniformField.m, line 14):
```matlab
VecField(:,:,jj) = VecField(:,:,jj)./(VecField(1,:,jj).^2+VecField(2,:,jj).^2+VecField(3,:,jj).^2+VecField(4,:,jj).^2).^0.5;
```

**Python** (utils.py, lines 91-95):
```python
norm = np.sqrt(
    VecField[0, :, jj]**2 + VecField[1, :, jj]**2 +
    VecField[2, :, jj]**2 + VecField[3, :, jj]**2
)
VecField[:, :, jj] = VecField[:, :, jj] / norm
```

**Issue**: The norm calculation is a **4-vector Euclidean norm**, but for timelike/nulllike vectors we should potentially normalize with respect to the metric signature.

However, since the MATLAB code does the same Euclidean norm, this is consistent. The vectors are normalized in a coordinate-independent way before being used with the actual metric.

**Status**: Consistent between MATLAB and Python, but mathematically questionable.

## The Fix

### Fix 1: Correct the inner product contraction

In `/WarpFactory/warpfactory_py/warpfactory/analyzer/utils.py`, line 142-145:

**WRONG:**
```python
if vec_a['index'].lower() != vec_b['index'].lower():
    # Direct contraction
    for mu in range(4):
        for nu in range(4):
            innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][nu]
```

**CORRECT:**
```python
if vec_a['index'].lower() != vec_b['index'].lower():
    # Direct contraction - Einstein summation over matching index
    for mu in range(4):
        innerprod = innerprod + vec_a['field'][mu] * vec_b['field'][mu]
```

**Explanation**: When one vector is contravariant (V^μ) and the other is covariant (W_μ), the inner product is V^μ W_μ (sum over the same index), NOT V^μ W_ν (which would be a tensor, not a scalar).

## Verification Tests Needed

1. **Minkowski Test**: Energy conditions for flat spacetime should be exactly zero (T=0)
2. **Schwarzschild Test**: Known solutions should match literature
3. **Fuchs Shell Test**: Paper claims zero violations - need to verify after fix

---

## Index Convention Verification

### MATLAB (1-indexed):
- Loops: `for mu = 1:4` → indices 1, 2, 3, 4
- Array access: `tensor{1, 1}` → component (0,0) in physics notation

### Python (0-indexed):
- Loops: `for mu in range(4)` → indices 0, 1, 2, 3
- Array access: `tensor[(0, 0)]` → component (0,0) in physics notation

**Status**: ✓ CORRECT - The conversion properly handles 0-indexing vs 1-indexing

---

## Sign Conventions Verification

### Metric Signature:
Both MATLAB and Python use (-,+,+,+) signature for Minkowski:
- g_00 = -1
- g_11 = g_22 = g_33 = +1

### Energy Condition Signs:
- Negative values = violations
- Both implementations flip DEC sign at the end for consistency

**Status**: ✓ CORRECT

---

## Conclusion

**PRIMARY BUG**: The inner product function incorrectly performs a double summation (4x4 loop) when contracting vectors with different indices, instead of a single summation (1x4 loop) over matching indices.

**IMPACT**:
- Dominant Energy Condition calculations are completely wrong
- Results in ~10^40 violations instead of correct values
- Other energy conditions (Null, Weak, Strong) are NOT affected by this bug

**FIX**: Change the double loop to a single loop in the inner product function when indices are different.

**PRIORITY**: CRITICAL - This bug invalidates all Dominant Energy Condition results.
