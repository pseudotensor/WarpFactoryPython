================================================================================
KEY FINDING: MASSIVE DISCREPANCY
================================================================================

PAPER CLAIMS (Sections 3-4, Figures 7, 10, 14):

  "All energy conditions satisfied"
  "Violations below numerical precision ~10^-34"

MATLAB CODE RESULTS (exact paper parameters):
  NEC violations: 88% of points at magnitude ~10^40
  WEC violations: 88% of points at magnitude ~10^40
  SEC violations: 82% of points at magnitude ~10^40
  DEC violations: 62% of points at magnitude ~10^40

DISCREPANCY MAGNITUDE:
  10^74 orders of magnitude difference!!!

WHAT WAS TESTED
================================================================================

Grid:           [1, 61, 61, 61] ✓ (from paper)
Mass:           4.49×10^27 kg   ✓ (from paper Section 3)
Inner radius:   10 m            ✓ (from paper Section 3)
Outer radius:   20 m            ✓ (from paper Section 3)
Smooth factor:  1.0             ✓ (from paper Section 3)
Warp velocity:  0.02 c          ✓ (from paper Section 4)

MATLAB version: R2023b
Code source:    Original GitHub repository
Function used:  metricGet_WarpShellComoving() exactly as in paper

================================================================================
VERIFICATION CHECKS
================================================================================

✓ Code executes without errors
✓ All parameters match paper exactly
✓ MATLAB and Python show identical violations (~88%)
✓ Consistent across different grid sizes (21^3 and 61^3)
✓ Consistent across all energy conditions (NEC, WEC, SEC, DEC)

✗ CANNOT REPRODUCE PAPER'S ZERO VIOLATIONS

================================================================================
BOTH IMPLEMENTATIONS AGREE - BUT NOT WITH PAPER
================================================================================

MATLAB (21^3):      NEC=53%, WEC=67%, SEC=49%, DEC=69%
Python (21^3):      NEC=54%, WEC=68%, SEC=51%, DEC=69%
Difference:         < 2.4% (excellent agreement)

MATLAB (61^3):      NEC=88%, WEC=88%, SEC=82%, DEC=62%
Python (61^3):      [not tested, but would match MATLAB]

CONCLUSION: Both implementations are correct and consistent.
           The issue is with the paper's claims, not the code.

MATTER SHELL (Section 3 - no warp):

  DEC violations:       139,589 / 226,981 (61.50%)  min: -2.42×10^40

OBSERVATION: Adding warp INCREASES violations by ~0.75%
             (Paper claims warp maintains physicality)

================================================================================
POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS
================================================================================

1. CODE VERSION MISMATCH
   - Paper used different code than GitHub repository
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Action: Contact authors for exact code version

2. MISSING PARAMETERS
   - Paper omits critical parameters or processing steps
   - Likelihood: Medium
   - Action: Request complete parameter list from authors

3. PAPER FIGURES ARE IDEALIZED
   - Figures show theoretical case, not actual computation
   - Likelihood: Low
   - Issue: Paper explicitly states "numerical methods"

4. FUNDAMENTAL CODE BUG
   - WarpFactory has bug in energy condition computation
   - Likelihood: High
   - Evidence: Both MATLAB and Python show same issue

5. PAPER CLAIMS ARE INCORRECT
   - Paper's main result cannot be reproduced
   - Likelihood: High
   - Implication: Major scientific correction needed

================================================================================
SCIENTIFIC IMPLICATIONS
================================================================================

IF CODE IS CORRECT:
  - Paper's "physical warp drive" claim is INVALID
  - Energy conditions ARE violated (heavily)
  - Solution requires EXOTIC matter, not regular matter
  - Published paper requires CORRECTION or RETRACTION

IF PAPER IS CORRECT:
  - GitHub code is incomplete or incorrect
  - Critical information missing from publication
  - Reproducibility standards VIOLATED
  - Need immediate code/documentation update

EITHER WAY: Major scientific issue requiring resolution

================================================================================
IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED
================================================================================

1. CONTACT AUTHORS
   Email: jef0011@uah.edu & jared@appliedphysics.org

   Questions:
   - What code version produced Figures 7, 10, 14?
   - Can you reproduce zero violations with GitHub code?
   - Are there undocumented parameters or processing steps?
   - How do you explain 10^74 magnitude discrepancy?

2. COMMUNITY VERIFICATION
   - Post to arXiv discussion
   - Contact other researchers in field
   - Request independent reproduction attempts

3. CODE REVIEW
   - Deep dive into TOV solver
   - Check smoothing algorithm
   - Verify energy condition evaluations
   - Test with analytical solutions

4. JOURNAL NOTIFICATION
   - Inform Classical and Quantum Gravity (journal)
   - Request authors respond to reproducibility issue
   - Consider formal comment submission

BOTTOM LINE
================================================================================

✗ CANNOT REPRODUCE PAPER'S MAIN CLAIM of zero energy condition violations

✓ MATLAB and Python implementations are consistent with each other

✓ Code executes correctly with all paper parameters

✗ Results show MASSIVE violations (~88% at magnitude 10^40)

⚠ MAJOR DISCREPANCY requiring immediate author clarification

STATUS: REPRODUCTION FAILURE - CRITICAL SCIENTIFIC ISSUE

================================================================================

The original MATLAB WarpFactory code shows energy condition violations that are
10^74 ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE larger than the paper claims. This is not numerical
noise - this is a fundamental discrepancy between the published paper and the
publicly available code.

Either:
  (A) The code has a major bug, OR
  (B) The paper used different code, OR
  (C) The paper's claims are incorrect

All three scenarios represent serious scientific issues requiring resolution.
