## IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS

### Technical Architecture

**Time-Dependent Metrics:**
- Metrics stored as functions of time: g_μν(t, x, y, z)
- Time derivatives computed using finite differences
- Support for 2nd and 4th order accuracy
- Handles boundary conditions (forward/backward differences at endpoints)

**3+1 Decomposition:**
- Lapse function: α(r,t)
- Shift vector: β^i(r,t)
- Spatial metric: γ_ij(r,t)
- Metric built using: g_μν = three_plus_one_builder(α, β, γ)

**Energy Condition Evaluation:**
- Uses WarpFactory's `get_energy_conditions()` function
- Samples 50 angular directions × 10 temporal shells
- Evaluates NEC, WEC, DEC, SEC at each spacetime point
- Tracks violations over time

**Spatial Grids:**
- Default: [N_t, N_x, N_y, N_z] = [20, 40, 40, 40]
- Quick mode: [10, 20, 20, 20]
- Full mode: [30, 60, 60, 60]
- Spatial extent: -100m to +100m (default)

### Transition Functions Implemented

1. **Sigmoid:** S(t) = 0.5(1 + tanh((t-t₀)/τ))
   - Smoothest, symmetric around t₀
   - Most commonly used in physics

2. **Exponential:** S(t) = 1 - exp(-(t-t₀)/τ)
   - Smooth start, asymptotic approach to 1
   - Good for gradual onset

3. **Fermi-Dirac:** S(t) = 1/(1 + exp(-(t-t₀)/(kT·τ)))
   - Statistical mechanics inspired
   - Temperature parameter kT

4. **Polynomial:** S(s) = 3s² - 2s³ or 10s³ - 15s⁴ + 6s⁵
   - Continuous derivatives up to order n
   - Good for optimization

### Shell Parameters (From Fuchs et al., 2024)

- **Inner radius:** R₁ = 10 meters
- **Outer radius:** R₂ = 20 meters
- **Shell mass:** M = 4.49×10²⁷ kg (2.365 Jupiter masses)
- **Final velocity:** v_final = 0.02c ≈ 6×10⁶ m/s
- **Shape width:** σ = 0.02 m⁻¹

These parameters are proven to work for constant velocity case (Fuchs et al., 2024).

## APPROACH DETAILS

### Approach 1: Gradual Transition (Benchmark)
**Priority:** High (validation)
**Complexity:** Low
**Expected Performance:** 30-50% reduction

Simply transitions shift vector from 0 to v_final over time τ with smooth function S(t).

**Key Parameters:**
- `tau`: Transition time scale (10-100 seconds)
- `transition_type`: "sigmoid", "exponential", "polynomial"
- `t0`: Center time

**Physics:**
- Longer τ → smaller ∂ₜβ → smaller violations
- But doesn't eliminate violations, just spreads them out
- Benchmark for comparison

### Approach 3: Hybrid Metrics (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
**Priority:** Highest
**Complexity:** Medium
**Expected Performance:** 50-80% reduction

Separates acceleration into distinct stages:
1. Form stationary shell (proven physical)
2. Add shift vector to existing shell
3. Coast at constant velocity (proven physical)

**Key Parameters:**
- `t1`: Shell formation complete time
- `t2`: Shift spin-up start time
- `t3`: Constant velocity reached time
- `stage_mode`: "sequential" or "overlapping"

**Physics:**
- Pre-existing positive ADM mass provides "energy budget"
- Question: Can shell's 4-momentum change without external input?
- Most likely to show significant improvement

### Approach 5: Modified Lapse
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** Medium
**Expected Performance:** 10-40% reduction

Uses time-dependent lapse function α(r,t) during acceleration.

**Key Parameters:**
- `lapse_mode`: "static", "velocity_coupled", "spatial_gradient"
- `lapse_amplitude`: Fractional change in lapse (0.1-0.3)

**Physics:**
- α relates proper time to coordinate time: dτ = α dt
- Time-varying α creates Shapiro time delay
- Extra degree of freedom for optimization

### Approach 4: Multi-Shell
**Priority:** Medium
**Complexity:** High
**Expected Performance:** 40-60% reduction

Multiple nested shells at different velocities, staged acceleration.

**Key Parameters:**
- `shell_radii`: List of (R1, R2) tuples
- `shell_masses`: List of masses
- `velocity_ratios`: Relative velocities [0.4, 0.7, 1.0]

**Physics:**
- Gravitational energy transfer between shells
- Outer shells "drag" inner shells along
- More mass required (sum of all shells)

### Approach 2: Mass Modulation
**Priority:** Low (exploratory)
**Complexity:** Medium
**Expected Performance:** Unclear

Time-varying shell mass M(t) or density ρ(r,t).

**Key Parameters:**
- `modulation_mode`: "velocity_proportional", "acceleration_proportional", "exponential"
- `mass_amplitude`: Fractional mass change (0.1-0.5)

**Physics:**
- Where does extra mass come from?
- Could be gravitational binding energy
- No clear physical mechanism yet

### Approach 6: GW Emission (REVOLUTIONARY)
**Priority:** High (long-term)
**Complexity:** Very High
**Expected Performance:** Potentially 100% (or failure)

Uses gravitational wave emission as acceleration mechanism.

**Key Parameters:**
- `breathing_amplitude`: Fractional radius oscillation (0.1-0.2)
- `breathing_frequency`: Oscillation frequency (0.05-0.2 Hz)
- `asymmetry_factor`: Front-back asymmetry (0.2-0.4)

**Physics:**
- Asymmetric bubble deformation emits directional GW
- GW carries momentum backward
- Bubble recoils forward
- Most fundamental approach, but efficiency ~10⁻⁸

### Success Criteria

- Quantify scaling: violations vs. acceleration time
- Identify which approach works best

**Moderate Success:**
- 50%+ violation reduction
- Violations remain localized (not asymptotic)
- Physical mechanism identified
- ρ/|violation| > 10
