## THE PROBLEM

### What's Solved
✅ Constant-velocity warp drive (Fuchs et al., 2024)
- M = 2.365 Jupiter masses, v = 0.02c
- All energy conditions satisfied
- Uses positive ADM mass shell + shift vector

### What's Unsolved (THIS RESEARCH)
❓ Acceleration phase - transitioning from rest to constant velocity
- Time-dependent metrics (∂ₜg ≠ 0) typically violate energy conditions
- ADM momentum conservation unclear
- Naive approaches require negative energy

**Core Challenge:**
```
Passengers: du_i/dt = 0 (no local acceleration)
But coordinate velocity must change: d(dx^i/dt)/dt ≠ 0
Requires: ∂ₜβ^i ≠ 0 (time-varying shift)
Result: Time-varying metric → energy condition violations
```

**Research Question:** Can we make time-dependence physical?

## THEORETICAL APPROACHES

### Priority Tier 1 (Highest)

**Approach 3: Hybrid Metrics** ⭐
- Staged acceleration: form shell first, then add shift
- Separates two proven-physical states
- Pre-existing ADM mass provides energy budget
- Expected: 50-80% violation reduction
- **Most likely to succeed**

**Approach 1: Gradual Transition**
- Smooth temporal interpolation benchmark
- Longer τ → smaller violations
- Expected: 30-50% violation reduction
- **Validation and comparison baseline**

### Priority Tier 2 (Medium)

**Approach 5: Modified Lapse**
- Time-dependent lapse function α(r,t)
- Extra degree of freedom for optimization
- Expected: 10-40% violation reduction

**Approach 4: Multi-Shell**
- Multiple nested shells, staged acceleration
- Gravitational energy transfer mechanism
- Expected: 40-60% violation reduction

### Priority Tier 3 (Exploratory/Revolutionary)

**Approach 6: GW Emission** ⭐
- Asymmetric bubble breathing emits directional GW
- GW momentum provides reactionless thrust
- Expected: Complete solution (100%) OR total failure
- **Most speculative, highest potential**

**Approach 2: Mass Modulation**
- Time-varying shell mass
- No clear physical mechanism yet
- Expected: Unclear, exploratory

## KEY RESEARCH FINDINGS (Literature 2020-2025)

1. **ADM Mass Problem** (Schuster et al., 2023)
   - Constant-velocity warp bubbles have zero ADM mass
   - Acceleration requires positive ADM mass

2. **Gravitational Waves** (2024 research)
   - Warp bubble dynamics emit GW
   - ADM mass changes during acceleration
   - Suggests GW might provide physical mechanism

3. **Physical Requirements** (Bobrick & Martire, 2021; Fuchs et al., 2024)
   - Positive ADM mass: M_ADM > 0
   - Energy density dominance: ρ >> |P| + |p_i|
   - Subluminal speeds required
   - Non-unit lapse + non-flat spatial metric necessary
