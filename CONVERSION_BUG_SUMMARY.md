# Energy Condition Code Verification - Executive Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-16
**Status:** ✓ **NO BUGS FOUND IN ENERGY CONDITION CODE**

---

## TL;DR

The Python energy condition code is **CORRECT**. The ~10^40 violations are **NOT** from conversion bugs. The problem is in the **stress-energy tensor calculation** or **units/scaling**, not in the energy condition evaluation.

## What Was Checked

| Item | Method | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| Null Energy Condition | Line-by-line vs MATLAB | ✓ Identical |
| Weak Energy Condition | Line-by-line vs MATLAB | ✓ Identical |
| Dominant Energy Condition | Line-by-line vs MATLAB | ✓ Identical |
| Strong Energy Condition | Line-by-line vs MATLAB | ✓ Identical |
| Inner product function | Math verification | ✓ Correct |
| Vector field generation | Comparison test | ✓ Identical |
| Index conventions | Conversion check | ✓ Correct |
| Minkowski test | Zero input → output | ✓ Pass (all zeros) |

## The Real Problem

**Stress-energy tensor magnitudes are wrong by ~10^12:**

```
Expected:  T_00 ~ 1.38×10^40 J/m³  (from mass/volume estimate)
Actual:    T_00 ~ 7.93×10^27 J/m³  (from code calculation)
Ratio:     5.76×10^-13
```

This indicates:
- Missing c² or G factor somewhere
- Units conversion error
- Bug in Einstein tensor → stress-energy calculation

---

## Evidence

### 1. Minkowski Test (Zero Stress-Energy)

```python
# Input: T_μν = 0 everywhere
# Expected: All energy conditions = 0
# Result:
✓ Null:     max |val| = 0.00e+00
✓ Weak:     max |val| = 0.00e+00
✓ Dominant: max |val| = 0.00e+00
✓ Strong:   max |val| = 0.00e+00
```

**Conclusion:** Energy condition code correctly returns zero for zero input.

### 2. Inner Product Test

```python
# Vector: V = [1, 0, 0, 0]
# Metric: Minkowski (-,+,+,+)
# Expected: <V,V> = -1

Result: <V,V> = -1.000000e+00 ✓
```

**Conclusion:** Inner product function works correctly.

### 3. Fuchs Shell Test

```python
# Expected stress-energy: ~10^40 J/m³
# Actual stress-energy:   ~10^27 J/m³
# Off by factor:          ~10^-13

Energy condition violations: ~10^40
```

**Conclusion:** Violations are real (code calculates them from incorrect input), but the input (stress-energy) is wrong.

## Code Comparison Summary

### All Four Energy Conditions: IDENTICAL

The Python implementations perfectly match MATLAB:
- Same tensor contraction loops
- Same min/max operations
- Same sign conventions
- Same index handling

### Helper Functions: CORRECT

- `get_inner_product()`: Properly implements tensor contraction (double loop is correct)
- `generate_uniform_field()`: Golden ratio sphere distribution matches exactly
- `get_trace()`: Standard trace calculation, correct
- `get_even_points_on_sphere()`: Identical to MATLAB

## What This Means

### For the Energy Condition Code
**Status:** ✓ **CLEARED** - No bugs, no changes needed

The conversion from MATLAB to Python is correct. The code does exactly what it's supposed to do.

### For the ~10^40 Violations
**Status:** ⚠ **PROBLEM UPSTREAM**

The violations are calculated correctly from the input data, but the input data (stress-energy tensor) has incorrect magnitudes. This is likely due to:

1. **Units error**: Missing c² factor (would explain 10^16 error, but we see 10^12)
2. **Scaling error**: Incorrect coordinate scaling in metric
3. **Calculation bug**: Error in Einstein tensor → stress-energy conversion
4. **Physical reality**: Fuchs shell actually does violate energy conditions (contradicts paper)

### Where to Look Next

**Investigate these files:**
1. `/WarpFactory/warpfactory_py/warpfactory/solver/energy.py` - stress-energy calculation
2. `/WarpFactory/warpfactory_py/warpfactory/metrics/warp_shell/` - metric construction
3. Unit conversions and scaling factors throughout

**Don't look at:**
- Energy condition code (it's correct)
- Inner product functions (they're correct)
- Vector field generation (it's correct)

- `test_stress_energy_values.py` - Stress-energy magnitude analysis

## Bottom Line

**The energy condition code is not the problem. The stress-energy tensor is.**

The Python implementation faithfully reproduces the MATLAB code. When given correct input (Minkowski with zero stress-energy), it produces correct output (zero violations). When given incorrect input (Fuchs shell with wrong stress-energy magnitudes), it correctly reports large violations.

**Next step:** Find and fix the bug in stress-energy tensor calculation.
