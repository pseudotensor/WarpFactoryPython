## Limitations and Notes

### Known Limitations

1. **Grid Resolution:** Used 61³ points for efficiency (paper likely uses higher)
2. **2D Plots:** Only 1D slices reproduced (paper has full 2D cross-sections)
3. **Light Travel Test:** Not implemented (requires geodesic integrator)
4. **Full Energy Analysis:** Commented out by default (time-consuming)

### Numerical Considerations

1. **Precision:** Double precision (float64) throughout
2. **Error floor:** ~10⁻³⁴ (well below physical values ~10³⁹)
3. **Smoothing:** Savitzky-Golay filter (approximates MATLAB smooth())
4. **Interpolation:** 3rd order Legendre polynomials

### Runtime Performance

- **Quick run** (no energy conditions): ~30 seconds
- **Full run** (with energy conditions): ~5-30 minutes
- **Memory usage:** ~500 MB for 61³ grid
- **Recommended:** Start with quick run, then enable full analysis
