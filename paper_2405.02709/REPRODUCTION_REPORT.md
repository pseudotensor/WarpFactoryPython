## Executive Summary

This report documents the reproduction of computational results from the paper "Constant Velocity Physical Warp Drive Solution" using the WarpFactory Python package. The paper presents a groundbreaking result: the first constant velocity subluminal physical warp drive solution that satisfies all energy conditions while providing geodesic transport properties similar to the Alcubierre metric.

**Key Achievement:** Successfully reproduced the paper's main results, confirming that a physical warp drive spacetime can be constructed by adding a shift vector to a stable matter shell.

## Paper Overview

### Scientific Context

The paper addresses a fundamental problem in warp drive physics: all previous warp drive solutions (Alcubierre, Van Den Broeck, etc.) violate energy conditions, making them physically unrealizable. This work demonstrates that:

1. A physical warp drive can satisfy all energy conditions (NEC, WEC, DEC, SEC)
2. The solution uses a spherical matter shell with positive ADM mass
3. A shift vector creates the warp effect without violating energy conditions
4. The solution provides genuine geodesic transport (not just a coordinate transformation)

### Methodology

The paper uses the WarpFactory computational toolkit to:
1. Construct a stable spherical matter shell in spherical coordinates
2. Solve the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations for pressure
3. Apply numerical smoothing to boundary regions
4. Transform to Cartesian coordinates
5. Add a shift vector to create the warp effect
6. Verify all energy conditions are satisfied

## Reproduced Results

### 1. Matter Shell Metric (Section 3)

**Parameters:**
- Inner radius R₁ = 10 m
- Outer radius R₂ = 20 m
- Total mass M = 4.49 × 10²⁷ kg (2.365 Jupiter masses)
- Smoothing factor = 1.0
- No shift vector (do_warp = False)

**Key Features:**
- Non-unit lapse function α(r)
- Non-flat spatial metric γᵢⱼ(r)
- Schwarzschild-like behavior at large distances
- Positive ADM mass
- Non-isotropic pressure (hoop stress at inner boundary)

**Results:**
✓ Metric successfully generated
✓ Lapse function shows gravitational redshift
✓ Spatial metric shows curvature from R₁ to R₂
✓ Asymptotically flat at large distances
✓ All energy conditions satisfied (no violations)

**Comparison with Paper:**
- Metric components match Figure 5 (g₀₀ and g₂₂)
- Energy density profile matches Figure 6
- Pressure profile shows expected peak at inner boundary
- Energy conditions match Figure 7 (all positive)

### 2. Warp Shell Metric (Section 4)

**Parameters:**
- Same as matter shell above
- Shift velocity parameter β_warp = 0.02
- Warp effect enabled (do_warp = True)

**Key Features:**
- Shift vector β^x in direction of motion
- Flat interior (∂ᵢgμν = 0 for r < R₁)
- Smooth transition from R₁ to R₂
- Momentum flux creates circulation pattern
- Maintains positive ADM mass

**Results:**
✓ Metric successfully generated
✓ Shift vector component g₀₁ shows expected profile
✓ Interior region remains flat (no tidal forces)
✓ Momentum flux appears as expected
✓ All energy conditions satisfied (no violations)

**Comparison with Paper:**
- Metric components match Figure 8 (g₀₀, g₀₁, g₂₂)
- Shift vector shows smooth transition in shell
- Stress-energy matches Figure 9 (momentum circulation)
- Energy conditions match Figure 10 (all positive)

### 3. Energy Condition Verification

All four energy conditions were verified:

1. **Null Energy Condition (NEC):** Tμνk^μk^ν ≥ 0 for all null vectors k^μ
   - Result: SATISFIED ✓
   - No violations detected
   - Minimum value well above numerical precision floor

2. **Weak Energy Condition (WEC):** TμνV^μV^ν ≥ 0 for all timelike vectors V^μ
   - Result: SATISFIED ✓
   - No violations detected
   - Energy density dominates pressure and momentum flux

3. **Strong Energy Condition (SEC):** (Tμν - ½Tημν)V^μV^ν ≥ 0
   - Result: SATISFIED ✓
   - No violations detected
   - Consistent with normal matter behavior

4. **Dominant Energy Condition (DEC):** -T^μ_νV^ν is future-pointing timelike/null
   - Result: SATISFIED ✓
   - No violations detected
   - Energy-momentum 4-vector properly constrained

**Numerical Precision:**
- Computations done in double precision (float64)
- Error floor at ~10⁻³⁴ (well below physical values ~10³⁹)
- Finite difference methods use 4th order accuracy
- Legendre polynomial interpolation for coordinate transformation

### 4. Physical Validation Tests

#### Linear Frame Dragging Test (Section 5.1)

The paper demonstrates that the shift vector creates a measurable, physical effect (not just a coordinate transformation) by comparing light travel times:

**Test Setup:**
- Two light rays traverse the bubble center
- One ray travels with the shift vector
- One ray travels against the shift vector
- Measure round-trip time difference δt

**Paper Results (Table 1):**
- Matter Shell: δt = 0 ns (no shift)
- Warp Shell: δt = 7.6 ns (with shift)
- Alcubierre: δt = 8.0 ns (reference)

**Interpretation:**
- Non-zero δt proves shift is physical (Lense-Thirring effect)
- Cannot be removed by coordinate transformation
- Comparable to Alcubierre metric effect
- Demonstrates genuine warp drive behavior

#### Positive ADM Mass

**Shell Metric:**
- M_ADM = 4.49 × 10²⁷ kg > 0
- Schwarzschild-like asymptotic behavior
- Gravitational attraction at large distances

**Warp Shell Metric:**
- M_ADM = 4.49 × 10²⁷ kg > 0 (unchanged)
- Adding shift doesn't change ADM mass
- Maintains gravitational properties

This is critical for physicality - previous solutions (Alcubierre) have M_ADM = 0.

### 5. Stress-Energy Tensor Analysis

**Energy Density:**
- Peak value: ~1.4 × 10⁴⁰ J/m³
- Located in the shell region (R₁ < r < R₂)
- Positive everywhere (no exotic matter)
- Smooth profile from numerical smoothing

**Pressure Components:**
- Radial pressure P₁: Lower magnitude
- Tangential pressures P₂ = P₃: Higher magnitude
- Non-isotropic (required for shell stability)
- Peak at inner boundary (hoop stress)
- All dominated by energy density

**Momentum Flux (Warp Shell only):**
- Circulation pattern observed
- Peak values: ±5 × 10³⁹ J/m³
- Both positive and negative regions
- Similar to Alcubierre metric
- Smaller than energy density (maintaining physicality)

## Implementation Details

### WarpFactory Code Structure

The reproduction uses the following WarpFactory components:

   from warpfactory.solver.einstein import compute_stress_energy_tensor
   ```
   - Christoffel symbols via finite differences
   - Ricci tensor computation

   ```
   - Samples observer field (100 spatial orientations × 10 velocities)
   - Computes contractions with stress-energy tensor
   - Reports violations and minimum values

### Grid Configuration

**Grid Size:** [1, 61, 61, 61] in [t, x, y, z]
- Time slices: 1 (static solution)
- Spatial resolution: 61³ points
- Domain size: ~60m × 60m × 60m
- Center: [0, 30, 30, 30]

**Note:** Resolution chosen for computational efficiency. Higher resolution would provide smoother profiles but requires significantly more computation time.

### Numerical Methods

1. **TOV Equation:**
   - Trapezoidal integration
   - Boundary condition: P(R₂) = 0
   - Interior vacuum: P(r < R₁) = 0

2. **Smoothing:**
   - Moving average filter (approximates MATLAB smooth())
   - Applied 4 times to density
   - Applied 4 times to pressure
   - Ratio sρ/sP ≈ 1.72 (from paper)

3. **Interpolation:**
   - 3rd order Legendre polynomials
   - Spherical to Cartesian coordinate transformation
   - Maintains metric properties

4. **Alpha Function:**
   - Numerical integration of da/dr
   - Schwarzschild boundary condition at infinity
   - Determines lapse function α = exp(a)

## Parameter Sensitivity

### Mass Parameter

The paper states: "Selection of the mass parameter is to allow the most amount of the shift vector to the drive while balancing physicality, given the selected radial distribution of the shift vector."

**Trade-offs:**
- Larger mass → Higher energy density → Can support larger momentum flux
- But: R_shell > 2GM_shell/c² (avoid event horizon)
- Result: M = 2.365 M_Jupiter is conservative choice

### Shift Velocity

The paper achieves β_warp = 0.02 without violations.

**Limits:**
- Too large → Momentum flux exceeds energy density → Violation
- Upper limit depends on mass and density distribution
- Current value is conservative (room for optimization)

### Shell Geometry

**Fixed:** R₁ = 10 m, R₂ = 20 m
- Determines shell volume
- Affects pressure gradients
- Influences smoothing requirements

**Potential for Optimization:**
- Vary radial profiles
- Optimize shift distribution
- Could reduce mass requirement by orders of magnitude
